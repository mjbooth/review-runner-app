### Core Tables (5 main entities)

```sql
-- businesses: Business accounts, settings, and configuration
-- customers: Contact database with business-level isolation
-- review_requests: Campaign tracking from creation to completion
-- events: Comprehensive audit log for all system actions
-- suppressions: GDPR-compliant opt-out and suppression management
```

### Key Relationships

- **Business → Customers** (1:N) - Complete data isolation per business
- **Business → ReviewRequests** (1:N) - All campaigns belong to a business
- **Customer → ReviewRequests** (1:N) - Track all requests per contact
- **ReviewRequest → Events** (1:N) - Full lifecycle tracking
- **Business → Suppressions** (1:N) - Business-scoped compliance

### Review Request Lifecycle

```
queued → sent → delivered → clicked → [followup_sent] → completed
   ↓        ↓        ↓         ↓              ↓
bounced  failed   opted_out  timeout     unsubscribed
```

### Data Design Principles

- **UUIDs for all primary keys** - Distributed system ready
- **snake_case naming** - Consistent PostgreSQL conventions
- **Audit fields** - createdAt, updatedAt on all tables
- **Soft deletes** - isActive flags preserve data integrity
- **Business-scoped queries** - Enforced multi-tenancy
- **Row Level Security** - Database-level access control

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

Review Runner implements enterprise-grade security measures:

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT-based authentication** - Clerk integration with business context
- **Multi-tenant by design** - Complete business-level data isolation
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** - Database-enforced access policies
- **API middleware validation** - Business access verification on every request

### Data Protection

## 📈 Monitoring & Observability

Comprehensive monitoring ensures reliability and performance:

### Structured Logging

```typescript
logger.info('Review request created', {
  requestId: request.id,
  businessId: request.businessId,
  customerId: request.customerId,
  channel: request.channel,
});
```

### Key Metrics Tracked

### Alerting & Observability

- **Error tracking** - Sentry integration for exception monitoring
- **Log aggregation** - Pino → Logtail for centralized logging
- **Performance monitoring** - Application and infrastructure metrics
- **Business metrics** - Campaign performance and engagement insights

## 🚀 Deployment

Our deployment strategy ensures high availability and seamless updates:

### Production Architecture

- **Frontend (Vercel)** - Automatic deployments from main branch with environment variables
- **API (Fly.io)** - Docker-based deployment with auto-scaling and health checks
- **Database (Supabase)** - Managed PostgreSQL with connection pooling and backups
- **Queue (Upstash Redis)** - Managed Redis for reliable job processing
- **CDN & Edge** - Global distribution for optimal performance

### Deployment Pipeline

1. **Code pushed to main branch** → Triggers automated deployment
2. **Vercel builds frontend** → Static generation with ISR where applicable
3. **Fly.io builds API** → Docker container with health checks
4. **Database migrations** → Automatic schema updates via Prisma
5. **Smoke tests** → Verify deployment health before going live

### Environment Management

- **Development** - Local development with Docker Compose
- **Staging** - Full production replica for testing
- **Production** - High-availability deployment with monitoring

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

Comprehensive testing ensures reliability across all system components:

### Test Coverage Areas

- **Unit Tests** - Business logic functions, utilities, and data validation
- **Integration Tests** - API endpoints with database interactions
- **Service Tests** - External integrations (Twilio, SendGrid, Google Places)
- **End-to-End Tests** - Critical user flows from request to completion
- **Performance Tests** - Load testing for high-volume scenarios

### Test Patterns & Examples

```typescript
describe('createReviewRequest', () => {
  it('should create request with valid data', async () => {
    const result = await createReviewRequest(validData);
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    expect(result.data.status).toBe('queued');
  });

  it('should reject suppressed contact', async () => {
    await createSuppression(suppressionData);
    const result = await createReviewRequest(requestData);
    expect(result.success).toBe(false);
    expect(result.error).toContain('suppressed');
  });
});
```

### Testing Commands

```bash
npm test               # Run all tests
npm run test:watch     # Watch mode for development
npm run test:coverage  # Generate coverage report
npm run test:e2e       # Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:integration # Integration tests only
```

### Quality Gates

- **80%+ test coverage** - Enforced in CI/CD pipeline
- **No critical vulnerabilities** - Security scanning with npm audit
- **Type checking** - Strict TypeScript validation
- **Linting** - ESLint with custom rules for consistency

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Follow these guidelines for consistent, high-quality code:

### Development Workflow

1. **Create feature branch** from `main` with descriptive name
2. **Follow coding standards** - See patterns established in existing code
3. **Add comprehensive tests** - Unit, integration, and E2E as appropriate
4. **Update documentation** - Include relevant updates to CLAUDE.md
5. **Submit pull request** - With clear description and test results

### Coding Standards & Patterns

#### TypeScript Conventions

```typescript
// Interfaces - PascalCase with descriptive names
interface CreateReviewRequestParams {
  businessId: string;
  customerId: string;
  channel: RequestChannel;
}

// Constants - SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
const MAX_SMS_LENGTH = 160;
const DEFAULT_FOLLOWUP_DAYS = 3;

// Functions - camelCase, descriptive verbs
async function createReviewRequest(params: CreateReviewRequestParams) {}

// Error handling with Result pattern
type Result<T> = { success: true; data: T } | { success: false; error: string };
```

#### Database Patterns

```typescript
// Always use transactions for multi-table operations
await prisma.$transaction(async tx => {
  const request = await tx.reviewRequest.create({ data });
  await tx.event.create({ data: eventData });
  return request;
});
```

### Quality Standards

- **TypeScript strict mode** enabled
- **ESLint + Prettier** configured and enforced
- **Result pattern** for error handling
- **Structured logging** with business context
- **Business-scoped queries** for multi-tenancy
- **No console.log** in production code

## 🔄 Recent Changes

### Architecture Simplification (August 2025)
**Masquerade Feature Removal**: Completely removed user impersonation/business switching functionality to simplify the codebase. This eliminates ~500+ lines of complex authentication logic while maintaining full multi-tenant security. All business owners now authenticate directly via Clerk with no impersonation capabilities, making the system more secure and easier to maintain.
